# ICO
Ethereum smart contracts for the shokoCAST ICO / crowd sale. Includes the ERC-20 token contract that models surrogate social utility tokens and equity convertible coins which will be replaced by shokoCAST's final implementation on the chain. 
shokoCAST is an amazing platform that will bring about the rebirth of sound and the evolution of music and will be built using TIMID, [Technology Innovations that are based on Multiple Interdependent Disruptions to the music industry] 
on a hybrid quadruple layered blockchain called SHOkolah. 
The platform will enable the creation of music by artists and beatmakers and DJs, 
collaboration and sharing; 
publishing; 
distribution; 
and consumption of music; 
live video, 360 video and augmented reality streaming [live concerts and events, ticket sales etc.]; 
curated music playlists or dRadio.
It will also have a transactional wallet called shokollet together with a secure and anonymous messenger called SHUSH! 
A tool to empower the powerless! 
Especially where one takes the time to consider emerging economies where are a person has is a cellphone and not even a bank account. 
Blockchain and it sfundamental principles can work wonders and its our intention to gain mass adoption starting in Africa to which we have tested and proved the model. 
Music is the core or chain that units people; from teh times of slavery, to colonisation, to exploitation, to all forms of abuse and censorship that still continues in less privileged economies - MUSIC IS THE THREAD THAT BINDS AS WE ALL CAN RELATE!!! 
shokoCAST gives empowerment back to the user and 'LIBERATES' the soul. 
As a colleagues once said, " Its now possible to release a track and earn a living  from middle earth or even the fiery fires of Mount Doom!
